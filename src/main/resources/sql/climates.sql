VALUES ('Alpine', 'The typical weather (climate) for elevations above the tree line, where trees fail to grow due to cold.');

INSERT INTO public.climates(name, description)
VALUES ('Desert', 'A dry climate sub-type in which there is a severe excess of evaporation over precipitation. The typically bald, rocky, or sandy surfaces in desert climates are dry and hold little moisture, quickly evaporating the already little rainfall they receive. Can be hot or cold.');

INSERT INTO public.climates(name, description)
VALUES ('Humid continental', 'Typified by four distinct seasons and large seasonal temperature differences, with warm to hot (and often humid) summers and cold (sometimes severely cold in the northern areas) winters. Precipitation is usually distributed throughout the year but often does have dry seasons.');

INSERT INTO public.climates(name, description)
VALUES ('Humid subtropical', 'A temperate climate type characterized by hot and humid summers, and cool to mild winters.');

INSERT INTO public.climates(name, description)
VALUES ('Ice cap', E'A polar climate where no mean monthly temperature exceeds 0 Celsius or 32 Fahrenheit. The climate generally covers areas at high latitudes and polar regions. There is limited animal life in most ice cap climates and they\'re inhospitable to human life.');

INSERT INTO public.climates(name, description)
VALUES ('Oceanic', 'A temperate climate sub-type generally featuring cool summers and mild winters (for their latitude), with a relatively narrow annual temperature range and few extremes of temperature.');

INSERT INTO public.climates(name, description)
VALUES ('Subarctic', 'A continental climate with long, cold (often very cold) winters, and short, warm to cool summers. It is found on large landmasses, often away from the moderating effects of an ocean.');

INSERT INTO public.climates(name, description)
VALUES ('Semi-arid', 'A dry climate sub-type. It is located on regions that receive precipitation below potential evapotranspiration, but not as low as a desert climate. There are different kinds of semi-arid climates, depending on variables such as temperature, and they give rise to different biomes.');

INSERT INTO public.climates(name, description)
VALUES ('Mediterranean', 'A temperate climate type characterized by dry summers and wet winters, with summer conditions ranging from warm to hot and winter conditions typically being mild. This type remains highly dependent on proximity to the ocean, altitude and geographical location.');

INSERT INTO public.climates(name, description)
VALUES ('Tropical monsoon', 'A tropical climate sub-type that has monthly mean temperatures above 18 Celsius or 64 Fahrenheit in every month of the year and a dry season.');

INSERT INTO public.climates(name, description)
VALUES ('Tropical rainforest', 'A tropical rainforest climate is typically hot, very humid, and wet. They experience high mean annual temperatures, small temperature ranges, and rain that falls throughout the year.');

INSERT INTO public.climates(name, description)
VALUES ('Tropical savanna', 'A tropical climate sub-type characterized by a dry month with less than 60 mm or 2.4 in of precipitation. In tropical savanna climates, the dry season can become severe, and often drought conditions prevail during the course of the year.');

INSERT INTO public.climates(name, description)
VALUES ('Tundra', 'A polar climate sub-type located in high latitudes and high mountains. At least one month has an average temperature high enough to melt snow, but no month with an average temperature in excess of 10 Celsius or 50 Fahrenheit.');

INSERT INTO public.climates(name, description)
VALUES ('Polar', 'Characterized by a lack of warm summers but with varying winters. Every month a polar climate has an average temperature of less than 10 Celsius or 50 Fahrenheit. A polar climate consists of cool summers and very cold winters, which results in treeless tundra, glaciers, or a permanent or semi-permanent layer of ice.');
